Estimate minimum Namenode RAM size for HDFS with 1 PB capacity, block size 64 MB, average metadata size for each block is 300 B, replication factor is 3. Provide the formula for calculations and the result.

1PB / (64MB * 3) * 300B = 10^15 / (64 * 10^6 * 3) * 300B = 10^9 / (64 * 3) * 300B = 1.6GB

HDDs in your cluster have the following characteristics: average reading speed is 60 MB/s, seek time is 5 ms. You want to spend 0.5 % time for seeking the block, i.e. seek time should be 200 times less than the time to read the block. Estimate the minimum block size.

read_time / seek_time = 200

read_time = seek_time * 200

seek_time = 5ms = 0.005s

read_speed = 60 MB/s

read_time = min_size_block / read_speed

min_size_block = read_time * read_speed = 0.005 * 200 * 60MB/s = 60MB

Create text file ‘test.txt’ in a local fs. Use HDFS CLI to make the following operations:

сreate directory ‘assignment1’ in your home directory in HDFS (you can use a relative path or prescribe it explicitly "/user/jovyan/...")
put test.txt in it
output the size and the owner of the file
revoke ‘read’ permission for ‘other users’
read the first 10 lines of the file
rename it to ‘test2.txt’.
Provide all the commands to HDFS CLI.

> hdfs dfs -mkdir -p assignment1
> hdfs dfs -touchz assignment1/test.txt 
> hdfs dfs -ls /assignment1
> hdfs dfs -chmod 640 /assignment1/test.txt
> hdfs dfs -cat /assignment1/test.txt | head -10
> hdfs dfs -mv /assignment1/test.txt /assignment1/test2.txt

To complete this task use the 'HDFS CLI Playground' item.

Use HDFS CLI to investigate the file ‘/data/wiki/en_articles_part/articles-part’ in HDFS:

get blocks and their locations in HDFS for this file, show the command without an output
get the information about any block of the file, show the command and the block locations from the output

> hdfs fsck /data/wiki/en_articles_part/articles-part -files -blocks -locations
> hdfs fsck /data/wiki/en_articles_part/articles-part -blockId blk_1073741825
